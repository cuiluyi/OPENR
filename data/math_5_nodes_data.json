        "partial_answer": "Let's solve the problem step by step using Python and sympy.\n\nWe can model this problem using a Markov chain with states representing different sequences of heads and tails. Specifically, we need to track the following states:\n- $S_0$: The initial state or the state after a tail.\n- $S_1$: The state after one head.\n- $S_2$: The state after two heads.\n- $S_3$: The state after three heads.\n- $S_4$: The state after four heads.\n- $S_T$: The state after one tail.\n- $S_{TT}$: The state after two tails (this is an absorbing state).\n- $S_H$: The state after five heads (this is an absorbing state).\n\nThe transitions between these states can be described as follows:\n- From $S_0$: Heads go to $S_1$, Tails go to $S_T$.\n- From $S_1$: Heads go to $S_2$, Tails go to $S_T$.\n- From $S_2$: Heads go to $S_3$, Tails go to $S_T$.\n- From $S_3$: Heads go to $S_4$, Tails go to $S_T$.\n- From $S_4$: Heads go to $S_H$, Tails go to $S_T$.\n- From $S_T$: Heads go to $S_1$, Tails go to $S_{TT}$.\n- From $S_H$: stay in $S_H$.\n- From $S_{TT}$: stay in $S_{TT}$.\n\nWe can set up a system of linear equations for the probabilities of reaching $S_H$ from each of the other states. Let $p_i$ be the probability of reaching $S_H$ from state $S_i$. Then we have:\n\\[\n\\begin{cases}\np_0 = \\frac{1}{2}p_1 + \\frac{1}{2}p_T \\\\\np_1 =\\frac{1}{2}p_2 + \\frac{1}{2}p_T \\\\\np_2 = \\frac{1}{2}p_3 + \\frac{1}{2}p_T \\\\\np_3 = \\frac{1}{2}p_4 + \\frac{1}{2}p_T \\\\\np_4 = \\frac{1}{2}p_H + \\frac{1}{2}p_T \\\\\np_T = \\frac{1}{2}p_1 + \\frac{1}{2}p_{TT} \\\\\np_H = 1 \\\\\np_{TT} = 0\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\n\nWe can substitute $p_H = 1$ and $p_{TT} = 0$ into the equations and solve the resulting system.
