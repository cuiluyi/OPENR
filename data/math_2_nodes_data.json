Combinations are used when the order of selection does not matter.\n\nThe total number of ways to choose \\( k \\) people from \\( n \\) people is given by the combination formula:\n\\[\n\\binom{n}{k} = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}\n\\]\nIn this problem, we have \\( n = 14 \\) (the total number of students) and \\( k = 6 \\) (the number of students we want to select). Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\\[\n\\binom{14}{6} = \\frac{14!}{6! \\cdot (14-6)!} = \\frac{14!}{6! \\cdot 8!}\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to calculate the factorials:\n\\[\n14! = 14 \\times 13 \\times 12 \\times 11 \\times 10 \\times9 \\times 8!\n\\]\nNotice that \\( 8! \\) appears in both the numerator and the denominator, so it cancels out:\n\\[\n\\frac{14!}{6! \\cdot 8!} = \\frac{14 \\times 13 \\times 12 \\times 11 \\times 10 \\times 9}{6!}\n\\]\n\nNow, we need to calculate \\( 6! \\):\n\\[\n6! = 6 \\times 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 720\n\\]\n\nSo, the expression simplifies to:\n\\[\n\\frac{14 \\times 13 \\times 12",
